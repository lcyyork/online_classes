    "# Union Find Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two operations\n",
    "1. FIND($X$): Return name of group that $X$ belongs to.\n",
    "2. UNION($p$, $q$): Fuse groups $p$, $q$ into a single one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eager approach\n",
    "1. **Invariants**: Each vertex points to the leader of its component.\n",
    "2. Data structure:\n",
    "  - a list for storing leaders (```leaders```) of each point\n",
    "  - $p$ and $q$ are connected if they have the same leader.\n",
    "3. FIND($X$): Return ```leaders```[$X$].\n",
    "4. UNION($p$, $q$): Change **all** entries with ```leaders```[$p$] to ```leaders```[$q$].<br>\n",
    "  For example: Merger 1 and 4, in array representation: 1 1 1 4 4 4 $\\rightarrow$ 4 4 4 4 4 4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lazy union\n",
    "1. Update only **one** pointer each merge.<br>\n",
    "  For example: Merge 1 and 4, in array representation: 1 1 1 4 4 4 $\\rightarrow$ 4 1 1 4 4 4\n",
    "2. UNION reduces to 2 FINDS: link FIND($p$) and FIND($q$).\n",
    "3. FIND operation needs to follow a path of parent pointers until finds the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Union by rank\n",
    "1. Purpose: to prevent the tree becomes to tall.\n",
    "2. Rank: ```rank```[$x$] = 1 + (max rank of $x$’s children) $\\Rightarrow$ rank of leaf is 0.\n",
    "3. **Invariant**: ```rank```[$x$] = maximum number of hops from some leaf to $x$.\n",
    "4. UNION($p$, $q$):\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  s1 = FIND(p), s2 = FIND(q)\n",
    "  if rank[s1] > rank[s2]:\n",
    "      parent[s2] = s1\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "      parent[s1] = s2\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # to restore the invariance\n",
    "  if rank[s1] == rank[s2]:\n",
    "      rank[s2] += 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "5. Worst-case running time of FIND is ${\\cal O}(\\log n)$ (From rank lemma: there are at most $n/2^r$ objects with rank $r$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Path Compression\n",
    "1. After FIND($x$), revise parent pointers to $x$’s root all along the path from $x$ to ```root```.\n",
    "2. Maintain ```rank``` **EXACTLY** as without path compression. Now ```rank```[$x$] is only an upper bound on the maximum number of hops on a path from a leaf to $x$.\n",
    "3. Running time:<br>\n",
    "  With Union by Rank and path compression, $m$ Union $+$ Find operations take ${\\cal O}(m \\log^∗ n)$ time. **[Hopcroft--Ullman]**<br>\n",
    "  With Union by Rank and path compression, $m$ Union $+$ Find operations take ${\\cal O}[m \\alpha(n)]$ time, where $\\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackerman function. **[Tarjan]**"
