    "This instance is so big that the straightforward iterative implemetation uses an infeasible amount of time and space. So you will have to be creative to compute an optimal solution. One idea is to go back to a recursive implementation, solving subproblems --- and, of course, caching the results to avoid redundant work --- only on an \"as needed\" basis. Also, be sure to think about appropriate data structures for storing and looking up solutions to subproblems.\n",
